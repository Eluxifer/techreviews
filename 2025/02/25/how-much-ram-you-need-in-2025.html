<h2 id="understanding-ram">Understanding RAM</h2>

<p>Before diving into specific use cases, it’s essential to understand what RAM is and how it impacts your computer’s performance. <strong>RAM</strong> is a type of <strong>volatile memory</strong> that temporarily stores data your system is actively using. Unlike storage devices like SSDs and hard drives, which store data persistently, RAM only retains data as long as the system is powered on.</p>

<p>The key role of RAM is to <strong>provide quick access to data</strong> that the CPU needs to perform tasks. When you open a program, it gets loaded into RAM for fast retrieval. The more RAM your system has, the more programs and processes it can handle simultaneously, leading to better multitasking and improved overall performance.</p>

<h3 id="how-ram-affects-your-computer">How RAM Affects Your Computer:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Faster Data Access</strong>: RAM is much faster than storage devices, so when you need quick access to data, it’s pulled from RAM rather than a hard drive or SSD.</li>
  <li><strong>Multitasking</strong>: More RAM allows you to keep multiple applications open at once without slowing down your system.</li>
  <li><strong>Smooth Performance</strong>: A sufficient amount of RAM ensures that you won’t face performance degradation when running memory-heavy tasks like video editing, gaming, or 3D rendering.</li>
</ol>
